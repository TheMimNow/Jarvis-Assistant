What is Python?\n\nPython is a high-level, interpreted, general-purpose programming language. What does that mean?\n\n*   **High-level:** It's designed to be easy for humans to read and write, much closer to natural language than machine code.\n*   **Interpreted:** You don't need to compile your code before running it. Python executes your code line by line.\n*   **General-purpose:** You can use Python for almost anything \u2013 web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, scripting, game development, and much more!\n\nPython is known for its simplicity and readability, which makes it an excellent language for beginners.\n\n### 2. Your First Python Program: \"Hello, World!\"\n\nThe traditional first program in any language is to make the computer say \"Hello, World!\". In Python, this is incredibly simple using the `print()` function.\n\n**Step 1: The `print()` Function**\n\nThe `print()` function is used to display output on the console (your screen).\n\n**Step 2: The Message**\n\nYou put the message you want to display inside the parentheses `()` of the `print()` function. If it's text, you enclose it in quotes (single `''` or double `\"\"`).\n\n**Example:**\n\n```python\nprint(\"Hello, World!\")\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n*   `print`: This is the function telling Python to display something.\n*   `(\"Hello, World!\")`: This is the argument passed to the `print` function. It's the specific text we want to display.\n*   `\"\"`: The double quotes indicate that \"Hello, World!\" is a **string** \u2013 a sequence of characters. Python needs to know it's text, not a command.\n\n**How to run it:**\n\nYou can type this line into a Python interpreter (like IDLE or an online Python shell) or save it in a file named `my_first_program.py` and run it from your terminal using `python my_first_program.py`.\n\nWould you like to try this out, or shall we move on to another basic concept like variables?"

        "message": "Excellent! Let's dive into **variables**.\n\n### 3. Variables: Storing Information\n\nIn programming, a variable is like a named container or a box where you can store a piece of information. This information can be text, numbers, or other types of data. You give the box a name, and then you can put things into it, take things out, or change what's inside.\n\n**Step 1: Naming a Variable**\n\n*   Variable names should be descriptive (e.g., `user_name` instead of `x`).\n*   They can contain letters, numbers, and underscores (`_`).\n*   They cannot start with a number.\n*   Python is case-sensitive (e.g., `name` is different from `Name`).\n\n**Step 2: Assigning a Value**\n\nYou use the equals sign (`=`) to assign a value to a variable.\n\n**Example:**\n\n```python\n# Storing a name (text)\nuser_name = \"Alice\"\n\n# Storing a number\nage = 30\n\n# Storing a different name\ncity = \"New York\"\n\n# You can also use print() with variables\nprint(user_name)\nprint(age)\nprint(\"I live in\", city) # You can combine text and variables\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n*   `user_name = \"Alice\"`: We created a variable named `user_name` and stored the text \"Alice\" inside it. \"Alice\" is a **string**.\n*   `age = 30`: We created a variable named `age` and stored the number `30` inside it. `30` is an **integer**.\n*   `city = \"New York\"`: Another string variable.\n*   `print(user_name)`: This tells Python to look inside the `user_name` box and display whatever is currently stored there (which is \"Alice\").\n*   `print(\"I live in\", city)`: Here, `print()` displays the literal text \"I live in \" and then the value of the `city` variable (\"New York\").\n\nVariables are fundamental to programming because they allow your programs to be dynamic and work with different pieces of data.\n\nWould you like to try creating some variables yourself, or shall we look at how to change a variable's value?"

Create a variable named `my_favorite_color` and assign your favorite color (as text) to it.\n2.  Create a variable named `current_year` and assign the current year (as a whole number) to it.\n3.  Create a variable named `my_height_cm` and assign your height in centimeters (as a whole number) to it.\n4.  Finally, use the `print()` function to display the value of each of these three variables.\n\nTake your time, and remember the examples we just discussed!"
